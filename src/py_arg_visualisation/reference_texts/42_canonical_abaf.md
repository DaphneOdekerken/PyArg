"Matti Berthold, Anna Rapberger, and Markus Ulbricht (2023). 
On the Expressive Power of Assumption-Based Argumentation. 
JELIA 2023: Logics in Artificial Intelligence, 145-160.") on _realisability_: 
given a set of 
sets $S$ and some semantics, does any assumption-based argumentation framework
exist such that its extensions are exactly $S$?
The answer to this question is dependent on the properties of $S$.

If you generate a set of formula sets (i.e. extensions) in the textbox, 
the algorithms in PyArg will automatically compute which properties apply 
to $S$. The result is shown in the table. In this table, one can also see 
which properties are required for specific semantics. For those semantics 
for which all properties are fulfilled, the "Generate" button is activated. 
By pressing this button, an assumption-based argumentation framework $\textit
{ABAF}$ is generated and visualised on the right. The extensions of 
$\textit{ABAF}$ are exactly the sets that were specified in the text box.
