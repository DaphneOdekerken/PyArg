The Watts–Strogatz model is a random graph generation model that produces 
graphs with small-world properties, including short average path lengths and 
high clustering. It was proposed by 
[(Watts and Strogatz, 1998)](https://doi.org/10.1038/30918
"Watts, Duncan J., and Steven H. Strogatz. "Collective dynamics of 
‘small-world’networks." nature 393.6684 (1998): 440-442.").
The implementation in PyArg is based on the 
[NetworkX implementation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.watts_strogatz_graph.html).
