On this page you can generate a simple abstract argumentation framework 
with the given number of arguments and defeats. You can choose whether you 
want the resulting framework to include self-defeats. The generator first 
creates the desired number of arguments and then randomly assigns a defeat 
until the desired number of defeats is reached.
